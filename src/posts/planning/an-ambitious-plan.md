## Homegrown National Park

The idea to convert the majority of our traditional lawn to a native landscape was inspired by Doug Tallamyâ€™s book Homegrown National Park. I was first introduced to the book after falling down a Youtube rabbit hole and landing on a video of a homeowner that was converting the grass patch in the front of their house to a native garden. They mentioned the book and the general subject matter which piqued my interest.

I went to our local library and checked out the book shortly after watching the video. This book shined a glaring spotlight on the fact that I understood very little about the landscaping on our property. I was under the assumption that because I had trees, bushes, and some flowers on my property that I was keeping my house nice and supporting our local environment.

I quickly learned that what I was assuming was very wrong. Many of the plants we choose for our landscapes have little to no ecological impact because most of them are from Europe or Asia and the animals, particularly the insects, have not adapted to utilize those plants. We pick them because they look good, but they are not contributing to the healthiness of our local environment.
