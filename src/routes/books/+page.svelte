				"Nature's Best Hope was the book that started me on the path of transforming our landscape. It opened my eyes to the importance of plant selection when designing our yards' landscapes, the detriment of buying into the turf lawn fallacy, our critical role in supporting our local habitats, and our power to make a difference even in our most urban areas.",

				'Planting In A Post-Wild World is the book I am currently reading. It dives into great detail about why certain landscapes, such as grasslands and forests, appeal to us humans and how to properly incorporate the concepts into our designs. Hence, they are appealing and avoid pitfalls that are off-putting.',
