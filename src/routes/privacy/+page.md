# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 25 Apr 2024

Our privacy policy is straightforward. There are only two reasons we need to collect personal information from you.

1. **Basic account information:** We need basic information to set up your account. This information includes an email address, password, and a username or name.
2. **Payment and contact information:** All payments are securely processed through our trusted third-party vendor, Stripe. For details on how they handle your personal information, please review [Stripe's privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

We are committed to your privacy. We do not collect other personally identifying information or use cookies to track you. A trusted third party, [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), collects our analytics and usage information. The data Plausible collects is in the aggregate, ensuring your anonymity. It is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR. Please review Plausible's [privacy-focused approach](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) and [data collection policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy) for more details.

Any information you include in your public profile, including your username or name, or post on our forums is public, so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
