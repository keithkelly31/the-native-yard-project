<section>
	<p>
		Your privacy is critically important to us. At Simple Lineup, we have a few fundamental
		principles:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal
			information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
		</li>
		<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
		<li>
			We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is
			shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
		</li>
		<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
		<li>
			We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>What This Policy Covers</h2>
	<p>
		Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to Simple Lineup’s website and other products and
		services collectively as “Services.” Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information
		about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.
	</p>

<section>
	<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
	<p>
		We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our
		Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information
		from two sources: if and when you provide information to us or automatically through operating
		our Services. Let’s go over the information that we collect.
	</p>

	<h3 class="italic">Information You Provide To Us</h3>
	<p>
		It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are
		some examples:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Basic account information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your
			account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for an account to provide an email
			address and password, along with a username or name — and that’s it.
		</li>
		<li>
			Public profile information: If you have an account with us, we collect the information that
			you provide for your public profile. For example, your username or name is part of that public
			profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo. Your
			public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding
			what information you would like to include.
		</li>
		<li>
			Payment and contact information: All payments are processed through our third party vendor
			Stripe. Please review <a
				href="https://stripe.com/privacy"
				rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"
				target="_blank">Stripe’s privacy policy</a
			> for information on how they handle your personal information.
		</li>
		<li>
			Communications with us: You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys,
			communicate with us about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up
			for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, or otherwise, we store a copy
			of our communications.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class="italic">Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
	<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Log information.</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that
			web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type,
			IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of
			access, operating system, and mobile network information.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Transactional information.</strong> When you make a purchase through our Services, we collect
			information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location
			of the transaction.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Usage information.</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services. We
			also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views and interactions
			with parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, operating
			system, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services
			to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand
			and make predictions about user retention.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Location information.</strong> LWe may determine the approximate location of your device
			from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people
			visit our Services from certain geographic regions.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Information from cookies & other technologies.</strong> A cookie is a string of information
			that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website
			each time the visitor returns. Simple Lineup uses cookies and other technologies to help us identify
			and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services.
		</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>How And Why We Use Information</h2>

	<h3 class="italic">Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
	<p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>To provide our Services.</strong> For example, to set up and maintain your account, provide
			customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.</strong> For example, by
			providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and
			analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our
			users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our
			Services easier to use.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong
				>To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.</strong
			> For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have
			a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services,
			analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after
			receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</strong> For example, by detecting
			security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal
			activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property
			of Simple Lineup and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating
			Services.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong> For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing,
			and preventing issues.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>To customize the user experience.</strong> For example, to personalize your experience
			by serving you relevant notifications for our Services.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>To communicate with you.</strong> For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback,
			share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Simple Lineup. If
			you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you
			opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class="italic">Legal Bases For Collecting And Using Information</h3>
	<p>
		A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information
		about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on
		the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the
		applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your
		account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for
		a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use
		is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have
		a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our
		Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to
		safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the
		effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor
		and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have
		given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access
		and analyze them later on.
	</p>

<section>
	<h2>Sharing Information</h2>
	<h3 class="italic">How We Share Information</h3>
	<p>
		We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your
		privacy. These are spelled out below:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Third-party vendors.</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors
			who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services
			to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment
			providers that process your credit and debit card information, cloud storage services, postal and
			email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services
			that help us communicate with you, those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing
			tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and
			by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services
			(like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs
			that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, and email and other communications);
			other third-party tools that help us manage operations.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Legal and regulatory requirements.</strong> We may disclose information about you in response
			to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>To protect rights, property, and others.</strong> We may disclose information about you
			when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
			rights of Simple Lineup, third parties, or the public at large.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Business transfers.</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or
			acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that
			Simple Lineup goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of
			the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen,
			this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information
			may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>With your consent.</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or
			at your direction.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Aggregated or de-identified information.</strong> We may share information that has been
			aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance,
			we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Published support requests.</strong> If you send us a request for assistance (for example,
			via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that
			request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We have a policy that we do not sell our users’ data. We aren’t a data broker, we don’t sell
		your personal information to data brokers, and we don’t sell your information to other companies
		that want to spam you with marketing emails.
	</p>

	<h3 class="italic">Information Shared Publicly</h3>
	<p>
		Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly. That means
		information like your public profile, avatar, other content that you make public on your
		website. Please keep this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>
	<p>
		We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which
		we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and
		we’re not legally required to keep it. For example, we keep web server logs that record
		information about a visitor to one of Simple Lineup’s website, like the visitor’s IP address,
		browser type, and operating system, for approximately 12 months. We retain the logs for this
		period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Simple Lineup’s website and
		investigate issues if something goes wrong.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>
		While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you
		against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do
		so.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Choices</h2>
	<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Limit the information that you provide.</strong> If you have an account with us, you can
			choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and
			billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features
			of our Services may not be accessible.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Opt out of marketing communications.</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional
			communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If
			you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those
			about your account and legal notices.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Set your browser to reject cookies.</strong> You can usually choose to set your browser
			to remove or reject browser cookies before using Simple Lineup’s website, with the drawback that
			certain features of Simple Lineup’s website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Close your account.</strong> While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account
			if you no longer want to use our Services. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your
			information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above — for
			example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance
			with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate
			business interests.
		</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Your Rights</h2>
	<p>
		If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall
		under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may
		have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or
		deletion of your data.
	</p>

	<h3 class="italic">European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
	<p>
		If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws
		give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided
		by the law, including the rights to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
		<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
		<li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
		<li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
		<li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>

	<h3 class="italic">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h3>
	<p>
		The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide California residents with
		some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share,
		where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. The CCPA also requires us to
		provide a list of the “categories” of personal information we collect, as that term is defined
		in the law, so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of
		personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);</li>
		<li>Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);</li>
		<li>
			Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a
			research survey for us);
		</li>
		<li>
			Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services,
			like the actions you take on our site);
		</li>
		<li>Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);</li>
		<li>
			Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you
			uploaded one);
		</li>
		<li>Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the
		Information We Collect section above. We collect personal information for the business and
		commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section. And we share this
		information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section.
		If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any
		exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business
			or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the
			information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of
			information we collect about you;
		</li>
		<li>Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;</li>
		<li>Opt out of any sale of personal information; and</li>
		<li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class="italic">Contacting Us About These Rights</h3>
	<p>
		You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and
		tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the
		other rights, scroll down to “How to Reach Us” to find out how to reach us. When you contact us
		about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you are the right person
		before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to
		contact us from the email address associated with your account.
	</p>

	<h2>Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)</h2>

	<h3 class="italic">Transferring Information</h3>
	<p>
		Because Simple Lineup’s Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we
		process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals
		operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us or third-party data
		processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Use Information
		section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take
		appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately
		in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law.
	</p>

	<h3 class="italic">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
	<p>
		Although most changes are likely to be minor, Simple Lineup may change its Privacy Policy from
		time to time. Simple Lineup encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
		its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below,
		and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (like adding a statement to our homepage or
		sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the Services
		after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.
	</p>

	<h3 class="italic">Translation</h3>
	<p>
		Our Privacy Policy was originally written in English (US). In the event of a conflict between a
		translated version of our Privacy Policy and the English version, the English version will
		control.
	</p>
