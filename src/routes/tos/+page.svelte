	<h2>The Gist</h2>
	<p>
		These Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and
		responsibilities when using our services. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you
		have any questions. <strong>If you don’t agree to these Terms, don’t use our services.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are a user in countries located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United
		Kingdom (“European User”), some special terms apply to you as mentioned below.
	</p>
	<p>

	<h2>Terms Of Service</h2>
	<p>
		These Terms govern your access to and use of the products and services we provide through or for <a
			href="/">Simplelineup.com</a
		> (“Services”).
	</p>
	<p>
		Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using
		any part of our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms and all other operating
		rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish via the Services from time to time
		(collectively, the “Agreement”). You also agree that we may automatically change, update, or add
		on to our Services as stated in the Terms, and the Agreement will apply to any changes.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>1. Who's Who</h2>
	<p>
		“You” means any individual or entity using our Services. If you use our Services on behalf of
		another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you’re authorized to accept the
		Agreement on that person’s or entity’s behalf, that by using our Services you’re accepting the
		Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity,
		violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us. We refer to
		“Simple Lineup” as “us,” or “we” throughout these Terms.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>2. Your Account</h2>
	<p>
		When using our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate
		information and to keep the information current so that we can communicate with you about your
		account. We may need to send you emails about notable updates (like changes to our Terms of
		Service or Privacy Policy), or to let you know about legal inquiries or complaints we receive
		about the ways you use our Services so you can make informed choices in response. We may limit
		your access to our Services until we’re able to verify your account information, like your email
		address. When you create an account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and
		services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to
		offer (i.e., marketing). Don’t worry — if you aren’t interested, you can opt out of the
		marketing communications. You’re solely responsible and liable for all activity under your
		account. You’re also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which
		includes keeping your password secure). We’re not liable for any acts or omissions by you,
		including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions. Don’t share or
		misuse your access credentials. And notify us immediately of any unauthorized uses of your
		account or of any other breach of security. If we believe your account has been compromised, we
		may suspend or disable it. If you’d like to learn about how we handle the data you provide us,
		please see our <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>.

	<h2>3. Minimum Age Requirements</h2>
	<p>
		Our Services are not directed to children. You’re not allowed to access or use our Services if
		you’re under the age of 13 (or 16 in Europe). If you register as a user or otherwise use our
		Services, you represent that you’re at least 13 (or 16 in Europe). You may use our Services only
		if you can legally form a binding contract with us. In other words, if you’re under 18 years of
		age (or the legal age of majority where you live), you can only use our Services under the
		supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to the Agreement.
	</p>

<section>
	<h2>4. Responsibility Of Visitors And Users</h2>
	<p>
		We haven’t reviewed, and can’t review, all of the content (like text, photo, and other
		materials) posted to or made available through our Services by users or anyone else (“Content”)
		or on websites that link to, or are linked from, our Services. We’re not responsible for any use
		or effects of Content or third-party websites. So, for example:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We don’t have any control over third-party websites.</li>
		<li>
			A link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse any
			third-party website.
		</li>
		<li>
			We don’t endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or not harmful.
			Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies,
			typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights,
			intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights of third parties.
		</li>
		<li>
			We aren’t responsible for any harm resulting from anyone’s access, use, purchase, or
			downloading of Content, or for any harm resulting from third-party websites. You’re
			responsible for taking the necessary precautions to protect yourself and your computer systems
			from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.
		</li>
		<li>
			We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications,
			transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Please note that additional third-party terms and conditions may apply to Content you download,
		copy, purchase, or use.
	</p>

	<h2>5. Fees, Payment, And Renewal</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of our Services are offered for a fee, like creating
		a team page (collectively, “Paid Services”). This section applies to any purchases of Paid Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Your subscription begins on your
		purchase date, and we’ll bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing monthly interval, on a
		pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time through the customer portal.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all
		fees do not include applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, value-added,
		goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges (“Taxes”). You’re responsible for
		paying all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases.
		If we’re obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees you’ve paid or will pay, you’re responsible
		for those Taxes, and we may collect payment from you.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Payment.</strong> You must provide accurate and up-to-date payment information. By providing
		your payment information, you authorize us to store it until you request deletion. If your payment
		fails, we suspect fraud, or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example,
		if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid
		Services), we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you.
		You authorize us to charge any updated payment information provided by your bank or payment service
		provider (e.g., new expiration date) or other payment methods provided if we can’t charge your primary
		payment method.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Automatic Renewals.</strong> By enrolling in a subscription, you authorize us to automatically
		charge the then-applicable fees and Taxes for each subsequent subscription period until the subscription
		is canceled. If you received a discount, used a coupon code, or subscribed during a free trial or
		promotion, your subscription will automatically renew for the full price of the subscription at the
		end of the discount period. This means that unless you cancel a subscription, it’ll automatically
		renew and we’ll charge your payment method(s). You must cancel at least one month before the scheduled
		end date of any annual subscription and at least 24 hours before the end of any shorter subscription
		period. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot
		be changed.
	</p>
	<p>You can view your renewal date(s), cancel, or manage subscriptions in your settings.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Fees and Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these Terms
		and requirements under applicable law. This means that we may change our fees going forward, start
		charging fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update features or functionality
		that were previously included in the fees. If you don’t agree with the changes, you must cancel your
		Paid Service.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Refunds.</strong> We’ll provide refunds if required by law. In all other cases, there are
		no refunds and all payments are final.
	</p>
	<p>
		European Users: You have the right to withdraw from the transaction within fourteen (14) days
		from the date of the purchase without giving any reason as long as your purchase was not of a
		customized nature, the service has not been fully performed, or subject to other limitations as
		permitted by law. For digital content, you agree that any purchase of digital content will be
		made available to you immediately and as a result you waive any right of withdrawal to such
		content.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you cancel this contract, we will reimburse you all payments we have received from you,
		including delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs resulting from the fact that
		you have chosen a type of delivery other than the most favorable standard delivery offered by
		us), without undue delay and no later than within fourteen days from the day on which we
		received the notification of your cancellation of this contract. For this repayment, we will use
		the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed
		otherwise with you; you will not be charged for this repayment. If you have requested that we
		begin our services during the withdrawal period, you will pay us a reasonable amount
		corresponding to the services already provided up to the time you notify us of the exercise of
		the withdrawal right compared to the total scope of the services provided for in the contract.
		If you cancel your contract with us, you will refrain from using the digital content or digital
		services or making them available to third parties.
	</p>

	<h2>8. Changes</h2>
	<p>
		We may modify the Terms from time to time, for example, to reflect changes to our Services
		(e.g., adding new features or benefits to our Services or retiring certain features of certain
		Services) or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons. If we do this, we’ll provide notice of
		the changes, such as by posting the amended Terms and updating the “Last Updated” date or, if
		the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may notify you through our Services or
		other communications. Any changes will apply on a going-forward basis, and, unless we say
		otherwise, the amended Terms will be effective immediately. By continuing to use our Services
		after we’ve notified you, you agree to be bound by the new Terms. You have the right to object
		to any changes at any time by ceasing your use of our Services and may cancel any subscription
		you have.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>9. Termination</h2>
	<p>
		We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without
		cause or notice, effective immediately, including if we believe, in our sole discretion, that
		you have violated this Agreement, any service guidelines, or other applicable terms. We have the
		right (though not the obligation) to (i) reclaim your username due to prolonged inactivity, (ii)
		refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any part of this
		Agreement or any Simple Lineup policy, or is in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii)
		terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any
		reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any fees previously paid.

	<h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
	<p>
		Our Services are provided “as is.” Simple Lineup and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim
		all warranties of any kind, express or implied, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law,
		including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
		purpose and non-infringement. Neither Simple Lineup, nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any
		warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or
		uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services
		through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>11. Jurisdiction And Applicable Law</h2>
	<p>
		Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any access to or
		use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of Pennsylvania, U.S.A., excluding
		its conflict of law provisions and the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts
		for the International Sale of Goods, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or
		relating to the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be the state and federal
		courts located in Washington County, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Nothing in this Agreement affects your
		rights as a consumer to rely on mandatory provisions in your country of residence.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>12. Limitation Of Liability</h2>
	<p>
		In no event will Simple Lineup, or its suppliers, partners, or licensors, be liable (including
		for any third-party products or services purchased or used through our Services) with respect to
		any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other
		legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the
		cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss
		or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed $50 or the fees paid by you to Simple
		under the Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, whichever
		is greater. Simple Lineup shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond
		its reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable
		law.
	</p>
	<p>
		European Users: If we cause damage to you and you are a consumer in Europe, we limit our
		liability to the maximum amount permissible in your country of residence. Liability will be
		limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations
		typical for this type of contract. Simple Lineup isn’t liable for damages that result from a
		non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability will not
		apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal
		injury caused by our negligence, liability caused by our willful misconduct or gross negligence,
		or our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you. You and we agree that
		we and our affiliates’ total liability is limited to the greater of $50 or the amount paid by
		you to use our Services during the 12 months preceding the claim; To the extent that our
		liability is limited or excluded, the limitations or exclusions will also apply to the personal
		liability of our employees, legal representatives, and vicarious agents.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
	<p>
		You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Simple Lineup, its contractors, and its licensors, and
		their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses,
		liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising
		out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of
		the Agreement or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in connection with
		the Services, Content that you post, and any ecommerce activities conducted through your or
		another user’s website.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>14. US Economic Sanctions</h2>
	<p>
		You agree that our ability to provide our Services to you is subject to compliance with US
		sanctions that restrict or prohibit who or from where our Services can be accessed. By using the
		Services, you represent and warrant that you (i) are not located or residing in any country or
		territory subject to comprehensive US sanctions (currently Cuba, Crimea, Iran, North Korea,
		Donetsk People’s Republic, Luhansk People’s Republic, and Syria); (ii) are not listed on any
		United States list of prohibited or restricted parties, such as <a
			href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists"
			rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"
			target="_blank">OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Persons List</a
		>, or otherwise subject to US sanctions that would prohibit your access to or use of our
		Services; and (iii) shall not use or allow access by any of your customers or potential
		customers (if applicable) to the Services in any manner that may cause Simple Lineup to violate
		US export controls and sanctions. We reserve the right to restrict or block your access, or
		access by any of your customers or potential customers (if applicable), to the Services and/or
		to terminate the Agreement at any time without notice if we determine, at our sole discretion,
		that such access may cause a violation or create unacceptable risk to us under export controls
		or sanctions.

<section>
	<h2>15. Translation</h2>
	<p>
		These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other
		languages, and in the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the
		English version, the English version will control.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>16. Miscellaneous</h2>
	<p>
		The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply to any specific Service)
		constitutes the entire agreement between Simple Lineup and you concerning our Services. If any
		part of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the
		Agreement, and does not affect the validity or enforceability of the rest of the Agreement. A
		waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any
		one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. Simple
		Lineup may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. You may only assign your
		rights under the Agreement with our prior written consent.
	</p>
