# Terms of Service

Last Updated: 25 Apr 2024

## The Gist

These Terms of Service ("Terms") describe our commitments to you and your rights and responsibilities when using our services. Please read them carefully and contact us if you have any questions. **If you disagree with these Terms, don't use our services.**

If you are a user in a country located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom ("European User"), some special terms apply to you, as mentioned below.

We've built this policy by adapting the Terms released under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license by Automattic. You can grab a copy of these Terms and other legal documents on [Github](https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic). You're welcome to copy, adapt, and repurpose them. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices.

## Terms Of Service

These Terms govern your access to and use of the products and services we provide through or for [{company}](/) ("Services").

Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish via the Services from time to time (collectively, the "Agreement"). You also agree that we may automatically change, update, or add on to our Services as stated in the Terms, and the Agreement will apply to any changes.

## 1. Who's Who

"You" means any individual or entity using our Services. Suppose you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity. In that case, you represent and warrant that you're authorized to accept the Agreement on that person's or entity's behalf, that by using our Services, you're accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us. We refer to "{company}" as "us" or "we" throughout these Terms.

## 2. Your Account

When using our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information and to keep the information current so that we can communicate with you about your account. We may need to send you emails about notable updates (like changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy) or to let you know about legal inquiries or complaints we receive about how you use our Services so you can make informed choices in response. We may limit your access to our Services until we verify your account information, like your email address. When you create an account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to offer (i.e., marketing). If you aren't interested, you can opt out of the marketing communications. You're solely responsible and liable for all activity under your account. You're also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which includes keeping your password secure). We're not liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages incurred due to your acts or omissions. Don't share or misuse your access credentials. Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other security breach. "If we suspect your account is compromised, we may suspend or disable it for security reasons." If you'd like to learn how we handle the data you provide, please see our [privacy policy](/privacy).

## 3. Minimum Age Requirements

Our services are intended for adults and not directed towards children. You are not permitted to access or use our Services if you're under 13 (or 16 in Europe). If you register as a user or otherwise use our Services, you represent that you're at least 13 (or 16 in Europe). You may use our Services only if you can legally form a binding contract with us. In other words, if you're under 18 years of age (or the legal age of majority where you live), you can only use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to the Agreement.

## 4. Responsibility Of Visitors And Users

Please be aware that we cannot review all of the content, such as text, photos, and other materials, posted on our Services by third parties or users ("Content"), including any content found on websites linked to or from our Services. We hold no responsibility for any use or effects of the Content or third-party websites. For example:

- We don't have any control over third-party websites.
- A link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse any third-party website.
- We don't endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, helpful, or not harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights of third parties.
- We aren't responsible for any harm resulting from anyone's access, use, purchase, or downloading of Content or for any harm resulting from third-party websites. You're responsible for taking the necessary precautions to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.
- We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.

Please note that additional third-party terms and conditions may apply to Content you download, copy, purchase, or use.

## 5. Fees, Payment, And Renewal

**Fees for Paid Services.** Some of our Services are offered for a fee (collectively, "Paid Services"). This section applies to any purchases of Paid Services.

By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Your subscription begins on your purchase date, and we'll bill or charge you on a pre-pay basis at the automatically renewing monthly interval until you cancel, which you can do at any time through the customer portal.

**Taxes.** To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable federal, provincial, state, local, or other governmental sales, value-added goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges ("Taxes"). You're responsible for paying all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we're obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees you've paid or will pay, you're responsible for those Taxes, and we may collect payment from you.

**Payment.** You must provide accurate and up-to-date payment information. By providing your payment information, you authorize us to store it until you request deletion. If your payment fails, we suspect fraud or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services), we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you. You authorize us to charge any updated payment information provided by your bank or payment service provider (e.g., new expiration date) or other payment methods offered if we can't charge your primary payment method.

**Automatic Renewals.** By subscribing, you authorize automatic charges of applicable fees and taxes until cancellation. Suppose you received a discount, used a coupon code, or subscribed during a free trial or promotion. In that case, your subscription will automatically renew for the total subscription price at the end of the discount period. Unless you cancel a subscription, it'll automatically renew, and we'll charge your payment method(s). You must cancel at least one month before the scheduled end date of any annual subscription and at least 24 hours before the end of any shorter subscription period. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the original purchase date and cannot be changed.

You can view your renewal date(s), cancel, or manage subscriptions in your settings.

**Fees and Changes.** We may change our fees at any time per these Terms and requirements under applicable law. Future fee changes include the possibility of charging for previously free services and the addition, removal, or update of features and functionality previously included in the fees. If you disagree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.

**Refunds.** We'll provide refunds if required by law. In all other cases, there will be no refunds, and all payments are final.

**European Users:** You are entitled to cancel your purchase within fourteen (14) days from the date of purchase without stating any reasons, provided that the purchase was not customized, the service has not been fully provided, or is not otherwise limited by law. For digital content, you agree that any purchase of digital content will be made available to you immediately, and as a result, you waive any right of withdrawal from such content.

If you cancel this contract, we will reimburse you all payments we have received from you, including delivery costs (except additional costs resulting from the fact that you have chosen a type of delivery other than the most favorable standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and no later than within fourteen days from the day on which we received the notification of your cancellation of this contract. We will use the same payment method for this repayment. Otherwise, we will not charge you. Suppose you have requested that we begin our services during the withdrawal period. In that case, you will pay us a reasonable amount corresponding to the services already provided when you notify us of the right to withdrawal exercise compared to the total scope of the services in the contract. If you cancel your contract with us, you will refrain from using digital content or digital services or making them available to third parties.

## 6. Feedback

When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you agree that we can use them without restriction or compensation.

## 7. General Representation And Warranty

We encourage you to express yourself freely, subject to a few requirements. In particular, you represent and warrant that your use of our Services:

- Will be in strict accordance with the Agreement;
- Will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, all applicable laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, privacy, data protection, the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside, the use or provision of financial services, notification, and consumer protection, unfair competition, and false advertising);
- Will not be for any unlawful purposes, to publish illegal content, or in furtherance of illegal activities;
- Will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of {company} or any third party;
- Will not overburden or interfere with our systems or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, as determined by us in our sole discretion;

- Will not involve renting, leasing, loaning, selling, or reselling the Services or related data without our consent.

## 8. Changes

We may modify the Terms from time to time to reflect changes to our Services (e.g., adding new features or benefits to our Services or retiring certain features of certain Services) or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons. If we do this, we'll provide notice of the changes, such as by posting the amended Terms and updating the "Last Updated" date, or if the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may notify you through our Services or other communications. Any changes will apply on a going-forward basis, and unless we say otherwise, the amended Terms will be effective immediately. By continuing to use our Services after we've notified you, you agree to be bound by the new Terms. You have the right to object to any changes at any time by ceasing your use of our Services and may cancel any subscription you have.

## 9. Termination

We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause or notice, effective immediately, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you have violated this Agreement, any service guidelines, or other applicable terms. We have the right (though not the obligation) to (i) reclaim your username due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any part of this Agreement or any {company} policy, or is in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any fees previously paid.

You can stop using our Services at any time, or if you use a Paid Service, you can cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section of these Terms.

## 10. Disclaimers

Our Services are provided to you "as is." {company} and its suppliers and licensors, as a result of this, disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Neither {company} nor its suppliers and licensors make any warranty that our Services will be error-free or that access to them will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from or otherwise obtain content or services through our Services at your discretion and risk.

## 11. Jurisdiction And Applicable Law

Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of Pennsylvania, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions and the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be the state and federal courts located in Washington County, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Nothing in this Agreement affects your rights as a consumer to rely on mandatory provisions in your country of residence.

## 12. Limitation Of Liability

In no event will {company}, or its suppliers, partners, or licensors, be liable (including for any third-party products or services purchased or used through our Services) concerning any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed $50 or the fees paid by you to {company} under the Agreement during the twelve (12) month period before the cause of action, whichever is greater. {company} shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond its reasonable control. The preceding shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

**European Users:** If we cause damage to you and you are a European consumer, we limit our liability to the maximum amount permissible in your country of residence. Liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising from a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. {company} isn't liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability will not apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, liability caused by our willful misconduct or gross negligence, or our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you. You and we agree that we and our affiliates' total liability is limited to the greater of $50 or the amount paid by you to use our Services during the 12 months preceding the claim. To the extent that our liability is limited or excluded, the limitations or exclusions will also apply to the personal liability of our employees, legal representatives, and vicarious agents.

## 13. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless {company}, its contractors, its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in connection with the Services, Content that you post, and any e-commerce activities conducted through your or another user's website.

## 14. U.S. Economic Sanctions

You agree that our ability to provide our Services to you is subject to compliance with U.S. sanctions that restrict or prohibit who or from where you can access our Services. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you (i) are not located or residing in any country or territory subject to comprehensive U.S. sanctions (currently Cuba, Crimea, Iran, North Korea, Donetsk People's Republic, Luhansk People's Republic, and Syria); (ii) are not listed on any United States list of prohibited or restricted parties, such as [OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Persons List](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists), or otherwise subject to U.S. sanctions that would prohibit your access to or use of our Services; and (iii) shall not use or allow access by any of your customers or potential customers (if applicable) to the Services in any manner that may cause {company} to violate U.S. export controls and sanctions. We reserve the right to restrict or block your access, or access by any of your customers or potential customers (if applicable), to the Services and to terminate the Agreement at any time without notice if we determine, at our sole discretion, that such access may cause a violation or create an unacceptable risk to us under export controls or sanctions.

## 15. Translation

The original language used to write these terms is English (U.S.). We may translate these terms into other languages, and in the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control it.

## 16. Miscellaneous

The Agreement (with any other terms we provide that apply to any specific Service) constitutes the entire Agreement between {company} and you concerning our Services. If any part of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the Agreement. It does not affect the validity or enforceability of the rest of the Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. {company} may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement with our prior written consent.
